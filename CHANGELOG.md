# Changelog for PHPCompatibilityWP

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

This projects adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) and [Keep a CHANGELOG](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [3.0.0-alpha1] - 2025-10-22

* Composer: All PHPCompatibility dependencies have been updated to the recently released PHPCompatibility 10.0.0-alpha1 based versions.
    Note: in select cases, this means that custom `<exclude>` rules in a project's `[.]phpcs.xml[.dist]` configuration file may needs to be updated.
    Along the same lines, selective `// phpcs:ignore` comments used inline may need to be updated with the new sniff code(s).
    For full information on these kind of changes, please refer to the [Upgrade guide for PHPCompatibility 10.0.0][phpcompat-wiki-upgrade-10].
* The [Composer PHPCS plugin] will now be installed automatically to register PHPCompatibility and other external standards with PHP_CodeSniffer.
    If you have a `require-dev` in place for this plugin in your own `composer.json`, it is strongly recommended to remove this to prevent conflicting version constraints.
    If you previously used another Composer plugin, manually set the `installed_paths` configuration, or set the `installed_paths` in your `[.]phpcs.xml[.dist]` configuration file, it is recommended you remove this in favour of letting the [Composer PHPCS plugin] handle this.
* Support for PHP 5.3 has been dropped. The new minimum supported PHP version is 5.4.
* Support for PHP_CodeSniffer 4.0 has been added.
* Support for PHP_CodeSniffer < 3.13.3 has been dropped.
